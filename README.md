# Timeline

## To setup and run this page

You will need to ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. They come together and can be installed from the [Official Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
You can check you have these two packages installed by checking their versions with terminal commands.

```
node -v
npm -v
```

Once these are verified, dependencies can be installed with ``npm install``

Then, clicking on the `startup.bat` or a shortcut to the same file will automatically start the serverside program, and launch the page in a browser.

## To add new entries

All the data is stored in a local excel file, adding new rows of data to this will add more slides to the timeline.

You will have to restart the server in order to have these appear on the timeline.
