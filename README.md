# Timeline

## Downloading Dependencies

Please make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. They come together and can be installed from the [Official Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
You can check you have these two packages installed by checking their versions in the terminal with the following commands:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

Once you have these installed, you can then install the project-specific dependencies by using the terminal, going to the project directory, and using the command ``npm install``

Once this completes downloading the necessary files, you can use the Timeline as specified below.

## Starting up the timeline

Click on `startup.bat` or a shortcut to the same file). 

This will

- automatically start the server-side program,
- launch the page in a browser.

## To add new entries

All the data is stored in a local Excel file `data.xlsx`

Adding new rows of data to this will add more slides to the timeline, ordered by date.

You will have to restart the server in order to have these appear on the timeline,

- ensure your changes have been saved
- close the page,
- close the server terminal if it didn't automatically `ctrl + c`
- reopen the timeline by clicking on the startup file
- 

### ## If you ever `git pull` to update the code

please keep a backup of your media and your Excel as these might get overwritten in this process.
